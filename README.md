remote-control is a bash script that create an anonymous environment using a VPN, that conduct scans on a target IP address and can access your logs securely via ssh, telnet, ftp using:

[nipe](https://github.com/htrgouvea/nipe), [nmap](https://www.kali.org/tools/nmap/), [whois](https://www.kali.org/tools/whois/) and [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl).

### Possibility and Capability

> ADVANTAGES:

- check for every errors possible. (correct answers as input, if the VPN is truly active or if he failed)

- the required dependencies and libraries will be scanned and any missing packages will be installed automatically.

- use -i for info for the script resume, type [sudo] bash  / ./remote-control -i

- use -h for help for the script usage, type [sudo] bash  / ./remote-control -h

- help and info menu doesn't require sudo privileges.

> DISADVANTAGES:

- nipe could fail, restart manually or restart the computer connection.
